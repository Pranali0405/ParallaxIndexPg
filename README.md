# ParallaxIndexPg
This repository showcases a visually captivating website index page implemented with parallax scrolling, a technique that creates a dynamic and immersive user experience. 

The parallax effect is a visually captivating technique that adds depth and dynamism to websites, transforming the way users interact with digital content.
Derived from the Greek word "parallaxis," meaning alteration, the parallax effect involves the relative motion of elements in the foreground and background,
creating an illusion of depth within a two-dimensional space. This effect is harnessed through clever web design, where different layers of images or elements move at varying speeds as the user scrolls down the page.
